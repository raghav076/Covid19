# A Web App that shows live covid19 cases in the Country


## Main Highlights

- A user can select the region for which he wants to see the cases, which can be India, any State or a particular District
- This app has been created using Reactjs framework
- I have used a govt api to fetch the data of live cases, and fetched the data using axios
- I have used react-redux to store and access the data
